# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a complete integration system that allows users to process data from Google Sheets through Cerebras AI and return the results back to the sheet. The system consists of three main components: a Google Apps Script interface, a serverless backend API, and integration with the Cerebras AI Node.js SDK. The solution enables bulk processing of text data with AI-powered rewriting capabilities while handling rate limits and errors gracefully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Google Sheets user, I want to use a custom REWRITE function in cells, so that I can process text data with AI by simply dragging the formula down columns like any other spreadsheet function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `=REWRITE("prompt", main_cell, context_cells)` THEN the system SHALL process the formula and return AI-generated text
2. WHEN the main_cell parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL use this as the primary text to rewrite
3. WHEN context_cells parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL include this additional information for AI context
4. WHEN the formula is dragged to other rows THEN the system SHALL automatically process each row with the relative cell references
5. IF any parameter is invalid THEN the function SHALL return a clear error message in the cell

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a serverless backend API that integrates with Cerebras AI, so that I can process text requests from Google Sheets reliably and cost-effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives a POST request with text data THEN it SHALL validate the request payload
2. WHEN valid data is received THEN the system SHALL call the Cerebras AI API using the official Node.js SDK
3. WHEN Cerebras AI returns a response THEN the system SHALL format and return the rewritten text
4. IF the Cerebras API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
5. WHEN multiple requests are received THEN the system SHALL handle them concurrently within rate limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle rate limits and errors gracefully, so that the system remains stable under heavy load and provides reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Cerebras API rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the errors and return meaningful error messages
3. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL retry the request up to 3 times
4. IF all retries fail THEN the system SHALL return a structured error response
5. WHEN processing multiple requests THEN the system SHALL queue requests to respect rate limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when using the REWRITE function, so that I can understand processing status and identify any issues directly in the cells.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the REWRITE function is processing THEN the cell SHALL display "Processing..." or similar loading indicator
2. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the cell SHALL display the rewritten text
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the cell SHALL display a clear error message (e.g., "Error: API unavailable")
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the cell SHALL show "Retrying..." before attempting again
5. IF the function parameters are invalid THEN the cell SHALL show specific parameter error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive deployment instructions, so that I can easily set up the system on Vercel or Netlify with proper configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following the setup guide THEN developers SHALL be able to deploy the backend API successfully
2. WHEN configuring the Apps Script THEN developers SHALL have clear instructions for connecting to their deployed API
3. WHEN setting up environment variables THEN the system SHALL validate required configuration
4. IF deployment fails THEN the guide SHALL provide troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include health check endpoints for monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the REWRITE function to be flexible and configurable, so that I can adapt it to various text processing scenarios with different prompts and context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the REWRITE function THEN users SHALL be able to specify custom prompt instructions as the first parameter
2. WHEN providing the main text parameter THEN the system SHALL accept cell references, ranges, or direct text
3. WHEN providing context parameters THEN the system SHALL accept multiple cell references or ranges for additional context
4. IF context cells contain multiple values THEN the system SHALL concatenate them intelligently for AI processing
5. WHEN the function is used THEN it SHALL support standard Google Sheets features like relative/absolute references and array formulas
