## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Engineering Tips

#### Effective Prompts
- ‚úÖ "Make this more professional and concise"
- ‚úÖ "Rewrite for a 5th-grade reading level"
- ‚úÖ "Convert to active voice and remove jargon"
- ‚úÖ "Create a friendly customer service response"

#### Avoid These Prompts
- ‚ùå "Make it better" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "Fix this" (unclear what to fix)
- ‚ùå "Rewrite" (no specific instruction)

### 2. Cell Reference Best Practices

#### Single Cell References
```
=REWRITE("Make professional", A1)  ‚úÖ Clear and simple
=REWRITE("Make professional", A1:A1)  ‚ùå Unnecessary range
```

#### Range References
```
=REWRITE("Summarize these points", A1:A5)  ‚úÖ Good for multiple items
=REWRITE("Combine into paragraph", A1:A10)  ‚úÖ Good for consolidation
```

#### Context Usage
```
=REWRITE("Personalize this email", A1, B1:C1)  ‚úÖ Main content + context
=REWRITE("Write response considering background", A1, B1:D1)  ‚úÖ Rich context
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### Cache-Friendly Patterns
- Use consistent prompts for similar content
- Avoid time-sensitive prompts that change frequently
- Group similar operations together

#### Efficient Formulas
```
‚úÖ =REWRITE("Make professional", A2)
‚úÖ =REWRITE("Summarize", A2:A5)
‚ùå =REWRITE("Make professional on "&TEXT(NOW(),"mm/dd/yyyy"), A2)  // Breaks caching
```

## Troubleshooting Examples

### 1. Common Error Scenarios

#### Empty Cell Reference
```
Problem: =REWRITE("Make professional", A1) returns "‚ùå Empty Cells"
Solution: Ensure A1 contains text content
```

#### Invalid Prompt
```
Problem: =REWRITE("", A1) returns "‚ùå Missing Prompt"
Solution: Provide clear instructions: =REWRITE("Make this professional", A1)
```

#### Rate Limiting
```
Problem: "‚è≥ Too Many Requests" error
Solution: Wait 1-2 minutes between large batches of requests
```

### 2. Formula Debugging

#### Check Function Status
```
=getSystemStatus()  // Shows API configuration and system health
=getCacheStatistics()  // Shows cache performance
=getErrorStatistics()  // Shows recent error patterns
```

#### Test API Connection
```
=REWRITE("Test", "Hello world")  // Simple test to verify API connectivity
```

### 3. Performance Issues

#### Slow Responses
- Check text length (keep under 2000 characters for best performance)
- Use simpler prompts for faster processing
- Consider breaking large texts into smaller chunks

#### Memory Issues
- Clear cache periodically: `clearAllCache()`
- Avoid processing extremely large ranges at once
- Use batch processing for large datasets
