```

Where:
- `"Make this more professional"` is your instruction to the AI
- `A1` is the cell containing the text to rewrite

```

#### Multiple Context Cells

```
=IF(LEN(A1)>200, REWRITE("Summarize this long text", A1), REWRITE("Expand with more details", A1))
```

#### Audience-Based Processing
```
=IF(B1="Technical", REWRITE("Use technical language", A1), REWRITE("Use simple language", A1))
```

### 3. Batch Processing Patterns

#### Sequential Processing
```
A1: Original text 1
A2: Original text 2
A3: Original text 3

B1: =REWRITE("Make professional", A1)
B2: =REWRITE("Make professional", A2)
B3: =REWRITE("Make professional", A3)
```

#### Template-Based Processing

```

#### Cultural Adaptation
```
A1: "Great deals this weekend"
B1: =REWRITE("Adapt for British English and culture", A1)
C1: =REWRITE("Adapt for Australian English and culture", A1)
```

## Performance Tips

### 1. Optimize for Speed

#### Use Consistent Prompts
```
‚úÖ Good: Same prompt for similar content
=REWRITE("Make professional", A1)
=REWRITE("Make professional", A2)

‚ùå Avoid: Varying prompts for same task
=REWRITE("Make this professional", A1)
=REWRITE("Professionalize this text", A2)
```

#### Avoid Time-Sensitive Prompts
```
‚ùå Avoid: =REWRITE("Make professional for today's meeting", A1)
‚úÖ Better: =REWRITE("Make professional for business meeting", A1)
```

### 2. Manage Rate Limits

#### Batch Processing Strategy
1. Process 10-15 formulas at once
2. Wait 30-60 seconds between batches
3. Monitor for rate limit messages
4. Use caching to avoid reprocessing

#### Stagger Large Operations
```javascript
// For very large datasets, consider Apps Script automation
function processInBatches() {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  const batchSize = 10;
  const delay = 30000; // 30 seconds
  
  // Process in batches with delays
}
```

### 3. Cache Optimization

#### Cache-Friendly Patterns
- Use identical prompts for similar content
- Avoid dynamic elements in prompts
- Group similar operations together

#### Monitor Cache Performance
```
=getCacheStatistics()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

#### "‚ùå Missing Prompt"
**Cause**: First parameter is empty or missing
**Solution**: Provide a clear prompt in quotes
```
‚ùå =REWRITE(, A1)
‚úÖ =REWRITE("Make professional", A1)
```

#### "‚ùå Empty Cells"
**Cause**: Referenced cell contains no text
**Solution**: Ensure the cell has content
```
Check: A1 contains text before using =REWRITE("prompt", A1)
```

#### "‚è≥ Too Many Requests"
**Cause**: Rate limit exceeded
**Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes before trying again

#### "üåê Connection Problem"
**Cause**: Network or API connectivity issue
**Solution**: Check internet connection and API configuration

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Responses
**Causes and Solutions**:
- Large text (>2000 chars): Break into smaller chunks
- Complex prompts: Simplify instructions
- Network issues: Check connection stability

#### Formula Not Working
**Check These Items**:
1. REWRITE function is properly installed
2. API endpoint is configured
3. Cell references are correct
4. Prompt is in quotes

### Debugging Tools

#### System Status Check
```
=getSystemStatus()
```
Shows:
- API configuration status
- Cache availability
- System health

#### Error Statistics
```
=getErrorStatistics()
```
Shows:
- Recent error patterns
- Most common issues
- Error frequency

#### Cache Performance
```
=getCacheStatistics()
```
Shows:
- Cache hit rate
- Storage efficiency
- Performance metrics

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Engineering

#### Be Specific
```
‚ùå Vague: "Make it better"
‚úÖ Specific: "Make this email more professional and concise"
```

#### Include Context
```
‚ùå Generic: "Write a response"

‚úÖ Audience-specific: "Explain this feature to non-technical users"
```

### 2. Content Organization

#### Structure Your Data
```
Column A: Original Content
Column B: Target Audience
Column C: Content Type
Column D: =REWRITE("Create "&C1&" for "&B1, A1)
```

#### Use Consistent Formatting
- Keep prompts consistent for similar tasks
- Use clear column headers
- Document your formulas

### 3. Quality Control

#### Review Process
1. Generate AI content
2. Review for accuracy and tone
3. Edit as needed
4. Test with target audience

#### A/B Testing
```
A1: Original content
B1: =REWRITE("Make more formal", A1)
C1: =REWRITE("Make more casual", A1)
D1: =REWRITE("Make more persuasive", A1)
```

### 4. Workflow Integration

#### Document Templates
Create reusable templates for:
- Customer service responses
